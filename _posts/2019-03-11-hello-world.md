Hello, world! Welcome to the blog, where I'll document what I'm working on, or
just whatever's on my mind. If you want some more off-the-cuff commentary,
better humour, or just more of me (I can't imagine why), [my Twitter page](https://twitter.com/lukeshorejones) is the
place to be. Or if you want to see my academic credentials and experience, head to [my
LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-shore-jones/) (this information should also be available on this website soon).

So... what exactly *am* I working on? Well, a website, apparently. The source
code for this site is a fork of a repository managed by GitHub to give all of us
wannabe software developers a kickstart. It's built using Jekyll, a super cool
static site generator - my job has been to take this default site and turn it
into something of my own, while graciously accepting all the neat doodads that
GitHub has given me out of the box, like easy peasy integration with their API.

Commenting on how much of this was done for me probably isn't the best way to
sell myself, but there's no going back now.

I work on all kinds of projects. Usually I like to write applications involving
some interesting mathematics, or games. Other times I just need to write
something to make a boring job a bit easier. And occasionally, I will write
something so useless that it could be considered a net negative to society as a
whole. It really just depends on how I feel at the time.

Anyway, that's all from me for now. I hope you got something out of this little
ramble. I'll post with every new repository I put up, and probably with some
interesting updates to existing repositories. And maybe I'll post some on top
of all that, but who knows what that'll be.

Thanks for reading,

Luke
