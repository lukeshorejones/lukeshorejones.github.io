title: About Me
---
Hi! I'm a data scientist and Computer Science graduate at the University of
Liverpool, as well as a co-founder of the UoL Game Developers Society.

I'm also interested in mathematics, statistics, and software development. I work
on a number of personal projects in my free time. All of my projects can be seen
from the Projects page accessible on the sidebar.

I have also made games, such as a tactical roleplaying game you can find on this
site - these games are often inspired by games I enjoy playing in my free time. 
In particular, I enjoy playing online games where I can work with groups of people.

My favourite programming language is Python, but I also have experience in Java,
SQL, and Haskell. I am also familiar with HTML and CSS.

My GCSEs (2011-2016) and my A-Levels (2016-2018) were earned at West Derby
School. During my GCSEs, I earned 3 A* grades and 6 A grades, including an
A* in Maths and A grades in English Language and Literature.

During my A-Levels, I earned a Distinction* in ICT, an A in Maths and Physics,
and a C in Further Maths.
